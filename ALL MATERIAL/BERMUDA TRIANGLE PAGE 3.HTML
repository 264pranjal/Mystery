According to scientists in the US navy,this area is one of the only two in the world where a magnetic <BR>compass points to true north rather than magnetic north.This probably cause some navigators go off <BR>course,which is very dangerous because many of the island in 'THE TRIANGLE' have large areas of <BR>shallow water where vessels can run underground.They can also sink a long way down as some of the <BR>ocean's deepest trenches,from 19,000 to over 27,000 feet belo sea level,are found here.<BR>

Since the island is in the atlantic ocean, the weather is influenced by several factors and can change with lightening speed.That means that one moment you have brilliant weather,whears the other moment,you may be faced with extremely perilousweather and hurricanes.<BR>

<LI><U><B>FORMATION OF METHANE GAS</B></U><BR>
It seems that large amounts gas (CH4)lie beneath the Bermuda Triangle seabed-and many other parts of the<BR> words  seabeds. Methane has no color or smell, it is light and it explodes easily.Escapes of seabed gas can <BR>therefore explain everything. As it rises through the sea, the water becomes less dense and ships start <BR>sinking. When t rises to sky, the same thing happens to the air and to the planes. Large gas escapes can also <BR>cause arias of rough, white water. Moreover, the rough water can (ionise) the air above and give it an <BR>electrical charge, making navigation equipment useless.  <br>
