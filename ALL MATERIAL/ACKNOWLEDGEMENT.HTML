This project results in hard work of all our  <br>
group members who were   <br>
<B><U><i>PRANJAL, PRIYANSHU, SARTHAK, NITESH, AASTHA AND AAYUSHI.</i></U></B><br>
This project is a special one as this is our first experience <br> <IMG SRC="IMAGES\1.GIF"  HEIGHT=170 WIDTH=120  align="left">
of using html to make a small website on our own and <br><IMG SRC="IMAGES\11.GIF"  HEIGHT=170  WIDTH=130  align="right">
for this we would especially like to thank our computer teacher <br>
<B><U><i>SIR KAPIL </i></U></B>who was there to help and guide us. <br>
Also a heartiest thank to our class teacher   <br>
<B><U><i>MA'AM RENU</i></U></B> and  our subject teacher <br>
 <B><U><i>MA'AM KIRAN</i></U></B> who were there to clear our doubts.<br>
At last a big big big thank to God who was always there with  us and by whose <br>
grace this project got completed as it was supposed to be.<br>
                                                       <B><U><i> THANK YOU</i></U></B>
