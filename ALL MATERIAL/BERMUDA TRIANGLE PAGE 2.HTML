Sea serpent reported by Hans Egede, Bishop of Greenland, in 1734.
Sea monster accounts are found in virtually all cultures that have contact with the sea. Avienus relates of Carthaginian explorer Himilco’s' voyage" ...there monsters of the deep, and beasts swim amid the slow and sluggishly crawling ships."  Sir Humphrey Gilbert claimed to have encountered a lion-like monster with "glaring eyes" on his return voyage after formally claiming St. John's, Newfoundland (1583) for England. Another account of an encounter with a sea monster comes from July 1734. Hans Egede, a Dano-Norwegian missionary, reported that on a voyage to Gothaab/Nuuk on the western coast of Greenland he observed A most terrible creature, resembling nothing they saw before. The monster lifted its head so high that it seemed to be higher than the crow's nest on the mainmast. The head was small and the body short and wrinkled. The unknown creature was using giant fins which propelled it through the water. Later the sailors saw its tail as well. The monster was longer than our whole ship.
